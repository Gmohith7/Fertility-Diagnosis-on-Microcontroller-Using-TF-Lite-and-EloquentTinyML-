# Fertility-Diagnosis-on-Microcontroller-Using-TF-Lite-and-EloquentTinyML-
This project builds a fertility classification model in TensorFlow, converts it to TensorFlow Lite, and runs it on an ESP32 using EloquentTinyML. The focus is on successful deployment to the edge device, not high accuracy, showcasing TinyML for low-power, real-time health applications.
